# Not Really Config Configs

I don't like spending time configuring things unless it's really necessary. This is a collection of scripts, configs, etc. that I have made as needed.

[**`del`**](https://github.com/blobbybilb/not-configs/blob/main/del) - rm on mac is scary
- a script to move files into trash
- uses Ruby because it's pre-installed on macOS (Sonoma)
